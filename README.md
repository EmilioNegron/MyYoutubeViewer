# MyYoutubeViewer
Generic DevByte Viewer used to showcase Android Architectural Components from JetPack

I have coded this testing app to highlight some of the powerful advantages to migrating an app to, or writing new apps, utilizing the latest and greatest Android JetPack Architectural components. I picked to list Youtube videos , based on the new C8 Mid Engine Corvette simply to show that technology is not bound to any rectangular device. It also lives in today's most exotic sports cars! In this case, American bread Cutting Edge Perfection! (Not just my opinion :) )

The following components/features are used in this app:

* The Retrofit networking library.
* The basic Android Architecture Components, ViewModel, ViewModelFactory, and LiveData.
* Transformations for a LiveData class.
* Building and launching a coroutine.
* Binding adapters in data binding.
* The Room database to create an offline cache.
* Using the repository Class to abstract an app's data layer from the rest of the app.
* How to load cached data using a repository.

NOTE: I used an online tool called "My Json Server" ==>  "https://my-json-server.typicode.com/" to set up a Fake Online REST server for use in my app. You can find my "db.json" file entries at: https://github.com/EmilioNegron/demo

Thanks for reading!!
